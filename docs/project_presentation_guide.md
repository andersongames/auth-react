# ReactJS Authentication Project

## 1. 📄 Proposal Summary/Project Objective

This project is an authentication application developed with **ReactJS**. Its objective is to demonstrate technical proficiency in building **interfaces protected by authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)**.

Initially proposed as a basic login and registration system, the project evolved into a more complete platform, with an emphasis on:

- Good practices for code organization and reusability (components, services, contexts)
- Backend simulation with `localStorage` and artificial delays
- Session control (persistence, expiration, and automatic logout)
- Differentiated access by user type (admin, user, editor)
- Continuous improvement of UX and accessibility
- Modern visual experience with responsiveness and dark mode
- Robust error handling and standardized messages

In addition to demonstrating technical skills with React, Hooks, Context API, Zod validation, Tailwind styling, and `react-hot-toast` usage, the project reflects the ability to deliver clean, secure, scalable, and usability-focused code.

## 2. 🔮 Project Presentation Guide

This script serves to present the project's current functionalities. It can be adapted as new functionalities are added.

### 🔐 Authentication and Session
- User registration with robust validation (`zod`) and dynamic feedback on password requirements
- Login with verification and conditional redirection
- Session persistence with `localStorage`
- Logout with visual feedback and secure state removal
- Session monitoring across multiple tabs (`storage` event)
- Automatic session expiration with redirection

### 🌟 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Supported roles: `admin`, `user`, `editor`
- Fine-grained control of routes and interface elements with:
  - `ProtectedRoute` (including with multiple allowed roles)
  - `RoleBased` (for interface conditionals)
- Exclusive routes:
  - `/admin-dashboard`
  - `/user-settings`
  - `/manage-content` (access by role group)
- Dynamic public pages with content adapted to the role (`/about`)
- Access denied page with a contextual message

### 👨‍💼 Administration
- `/admin-dashboard/user-list` page
- Listing of all mocked users
- Secure role change for users with validation
- Secure deletion of users with validation
- Protection against self-editing a role (admin cannot demote themselves)
- Success and error feedback with toasts

### 🌙 Theme and Style
- Dark Mode with toggle and persistence
- Modern layout with Tailwind CSS
- Reusable components:
  - `Input`
  - `Link`
- Base layout with `AppLayout` (header and footer)
- Page centralization with custom CSS (`--layout-offset`)
- Responsive and accessible styling
- Use of custom SVG icons in the footer
- Smooth transitions with `transition-colors`

### 🧐 UX and Accessibility
- Fully functional keyboard navigation
- Labels correctly associated with inputs
- Fields with `autoComplete` configured
- Visible and accessible focus
- Immediate feedback with a loading spinner and disabled buttons during submission

### ⚙️ Good Practices and Architecture
- Clear separation between interface logic, services, and context
- Services with simulated delay (`setTimeout`)
- `handleUnexpectedError` standardizes error handling
- `errorMessages.ts` and `successMessages.ts` centralize messages
- Centralized typings with `Role`, `StoredUser`, `RegisterPayload`, etc.
- Folder organization: `/services`, `/context`, `/utils`, `/types`, etc.

## 3. 📝 Technical Evaluation (as a senior developer)

### ✅ Project Strengths:
- Excellent code organization: clear separation of responsibilities (services, context, components, pages)
- High degree of attention to user experience (visual feedback, keyboard navigation, visible focus)
- Consistent use of modern React best practices (Hooks, Context, TypeScript typings)
- Solid implementation of role-based access control (RBAC), with support for multiple roles and conditional rendering
- Addition of valuable differentiators like dark mode, toasts, responsive layout, and basic branding
- Robust error handling and message centralization, increasing reliability
- Clean, cohesive code with good readability and ease of maintenance

### ⚠️ Opportunities for Improvement (future evolutions):
- Addition of automated tests (React Testing Library or Cypress)
- Integration with a real backend or services like Firebase for authentication
- Creation of a real administration panel with filters and complete CRUD actions
- Project deployment with continuous integration
- Internationalization (i18n) of messages

### 💬 Conclusion as a technical evaluator:
> This project demonstrates consistent technical proficiency in React, attention to UX and security details, and exemplary code organization.
> The progressive evolution of the application, combined with clear technical decisions, shows maturity and excellent preparation to work on modern front-end development teams.
